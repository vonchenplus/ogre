        @remarks
            Unlike 1.9; a Bone is practically a SceneNode in all purposes. It can even have
			objects directly attached to them. The only reason we need to overload is because
			the mDerivedTransform matrix is constructed differently, since it is not in world
			space, but rather in "offset space" (world space minus the reverse transform of the
			original bind pose).
			mDerivedPosition, mDeriverdOrientation and mDerivedScale are still in world space
			though, it's only the 4x4 matrix we send to the GPU that is in a different space.
