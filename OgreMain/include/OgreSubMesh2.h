        @remarks
            Meshes which make up the definition of a discrete 3D object
            are made up of potentially multiple parts. This is because
            different parts of the mesh may use different materials or
            use different vertex formats, such that a rendering state
            change is required between them.
        @par
            Like the Mesh class, instantiations of 3D objects in the scene
            share the SubMesh instances, and have the option of overriding
            their material differences on a per-object basis if required.
            See the SubEntity class for more information.

            @par
                We collect actually used bones of all bone assignments, and build the
                blend index in 'packed' form, then the range of the blend index in vertex
                data VES_BLEND_INDICES element is continuous, with no gaps. Thus, by
                minimising the world matrix array constants passing to GPU, we can support
                more bones for a mesh when hardware skinning is used. The hardware skinning
                support limit is applied to each set of vertex data in the mesh, in other words, the
                hardware skinning support limit is applied only to the actually used bones of each
                SubMeshes, not all bones across the entire Mesh.
            @par
                Because the blend index is different to the bone index, therefore, we use
                the index map to translate the blend index to bone index.
            @par
                The use of shared or non-shared index map is determined when
                model data is converted to the OGRE .mesh format.
