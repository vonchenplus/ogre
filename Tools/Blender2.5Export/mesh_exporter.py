# NOTE:
# The exporter will try to share vertex data by default.
# Sharing of vertex data is important to keep render state update small.
# This means that even if we are using different material submeshes in a mesh,
# the mesh's vertex data only needs to be assigned to the GPU once as it's shared.
# However on some special occasions we would not want to share vertex data.
#
# In the case of animated meshes, we sometimes want to split the meshes
# depending on different animation type within a mesh.
#
# Imagine an animated character with skeletal and pose animation for facial expressions.
# To be optimal, the facial vertex pose animation should be keyed in it's own submesh
# so as to avoid updating a huge data set of vertex points in software mode.
#
# In hardware mode, it is also essential to split parts that has more complex vertex
# animations from the skeletal skinning only parts. However as they will be using different
# shaders and hence different materials, this feature is not of any use here.
#
# Even so, in the case of a complex character with a lot of bones, hardware skinning may
# hit the limit of vertex shader registers for each bone matrix. To fix this, the mesh
# should be split into it's own individual submeshes in a way where the total number of
# bones affecting each submesh does not exceed the bone limit.
#
# One interesting case is the submesh alpha sorting case. When modelling things like cars
# or any models that have multiple transparent pieces, we may want to split the transparent
# parts into submeshes that can be depth sorted. Though in this case, we do not want to
# apply non shared vertex data on each submesh.
#
# In preparation of these cases, this exporter will take into consideration of the
# material settings. In the exporter settings under mesh tab, there will be a setting to
# flag materials to split meshes into it's own shared/non-shared vertex data submeshes.
# It will also have an option to allow custom naming of submeshes.
#
# For info on implementation see mesh_impl.py
