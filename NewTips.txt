Create static objects first.
Sort your creation order of Entities by frequency of creation & destruction: Entities that will be created & destroyed often should be done last. Entities that will never be destroyed should be created first, followed by Entities that will rarely be removed/destroyed.
Names are no longer unique (ie. two SceneNodes can have the same name). To identify uniqueness, use getId()
Detaching an Entity from a Node will set its visibility to false. Attaching it to a Node will turn it on. Any user-defined value passed to setVisible() will not be preserved after attaching/detaching. Setting visibility to true for an Entity that is not attached is not allowed and will crash the engine.
